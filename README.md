# PubMed Text Data Mining

- PubMed is considered the optimal database for medical and biomedical engineering research (Albahri et al., 2020). 
- Besides, PubMed searches the MEDLINE database and produces a comprehensive search of articles on abstracts (Jurca et al., 2016). 
- This text data mining can identify the annotated biomedical terms. 
  > For example, the genes' list will be identified with the gene names or Entrez IDs, then verified with controlled vocabularies like disease names. 
- The relationship between the biomedical concepts can be found, such as the gene-gene relationship or gene-disease relationship. 
- Hypothesis generation can occur with support and validation through experimental data. 
- Identifying genes hypotheses with the gene expression data can discover the new relationships between genes. 
  > For example, Gene Entrez ID 11260 points to gene Entrez ID 5901 in the directed graph, which can be derived from XPOT (gene Entrez ID: 11260) inhibiting RAN (gene Entrez ID: 5901) in the RNA transport (KEGG pathway ID: hsa03013) (Nies et al., 2021).
